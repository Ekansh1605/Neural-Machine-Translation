# Project---Neural-Machine-Translation
 Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is the task of using articial neural network models for translation from one language to the other.The NMT model generally consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation.The dataset comes from http://www.manythings.org/anki/.: I train using RNN based Encoder-Decoder model
